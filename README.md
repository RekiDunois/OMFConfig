# OMFConfig

The omf config I am using

## usage

First make sure `fish shell` was installed. You can follow the offical guide in [here](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell#getting-fish=)

And then install `oh-my-fish`, clone this repo into .config, install theme kawasaki, done.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish/master/bin/install | fish
cd ~/.config
mv omf omf.bak
git clone https://github.com/RekiDunois/omf.git
omf install kawasaki
omf reload
```
